# Bollinger Bands

Bollinger Bands are a technical indicator created by John Bollinger. They are used to measure the volatility of a financial asset by plotting two bands around a moving average.

Bollinger Bands are calculated by taking a moving average over a given period of time, and drawing two lines a certain distance away from that moving average. The distance between the two lines is determined by the standard deviation of the data series used to calculate the moving average.

Bollinger Bands are often used to identify support and resistance levels, as well as to detect overbought or oversold conditions in the market. When the price of a financial asset reaches the upper Bollinger Band, this may indicate that the asset is overbought and a correction to the downside is likely. Similarly, when the price reaches the lower Bollinger Band, this may indicate that the asset is oversold and a correction to the upside is likely.

**Calculation of moving average :**&#x20;

$$
\text{Moving Average} = \frac{1}{N} \sum _{i=1} ^{N} {x_i}
$$

**Calculation of standard deviation :**

$$
\text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum _{i=1} ^{N} {(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}{N-1}}
$$

_N_ = moving average rolling period

_xi_ = yield at time i

_x\__ = average of returns over the given time interval (_N_)
