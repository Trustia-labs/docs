## Systematic Portfolio Management

<details>

<summary>What is Systematic Portfolio Management ?</summary>

Inspired by the methodology akin to BlackRock's Systematic Investing, our solution marries the trinity of technology, robust data analysis, and human financial acumen. We're not just reacting to market evolution; we're leading it with a tailored approach to investment that sifts through uncertainty to find potential and performance.

Systematic investment strategies are among the most effective as they eliminate human bias in investment decision-making, enable the harnessing of vast datasets for investment insights, and utilize sophisticated analytical techniques to transform these data into useful investment information. True skill lies in constructing a balanced portfolio that optimizes the return on investment for a given level of risk.

At the heart of Modern Portfolio Theory is the concept of the 'efficient frontier', a line that represents the most efficient portfolios in terms of risk relative to return. At Trustia, our adjustable quantitative algorithms are designed to navigate and identify your ideal position on this frontier.

<summary>What is Dynamic Asset Allocation ?</summary>

Over time, asset allocations can change as market performance alters the values of the assets. Rebalancing involves periodically buying or selling the assets in a portfolio to regain and maintain that original, desired level of asset allocation. Those levels are intended to match an investor's tolerance for risk and desire for reward.

Our product doesn't just set and forget; it continuously analyzes market conditions to adjust your portfolio's asset allocation. This helps maintain a predefined level of risk or target a specific performance benchmark, adapting to market shifts and trends. Consider a market downturn where certain sectors are hit hard. Our dynamic asset allocation tool would adjust the weights of these underperforming assets to protect your portfolio.
