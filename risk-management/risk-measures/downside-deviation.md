# Downside Deviation

**Downside deviation** is a statistical measure that evaluates the negative volatility of an investment's returns. It is used in the calculation of the Sortino ratio to evaluate the risk-adjusted performance of an investment.

Unlike standard deviation, which considers both positive and negative deviations of returns, downside deviation only considers negative returns. Therefore, it measures the **volatility of potential losses** of an investment.
