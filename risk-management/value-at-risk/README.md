# Value at Risk

{% embed url="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rt0O_u4YedE9G-pJwg6ZJjVg_HWn0ABg/view?usp=share_link" %}

**Value at Risk (VaR)** is defined as the potential financial loss amount within a specific enterprise, portfolio or position over a given **time period** with a certain **confidence interval**. Risk managers use VaR to understand and control the level of risk exposure of a specific position or entire portfolio and use it to measure the overall risk exposure of an asset.

There are several methods for calculating VaR, ranging from simple methods based on **historical statistics**, parametric methods such as **variance-covariance**, to more sophisticated methods that use complex mathematical models such as **Monte Carlo simulation**. The choice of method will depend on the desired accuracy, available data, acceptable level of complexity, and the level of risk the enterprise is willing to take.
