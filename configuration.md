# Configuration

### Weighting Strategies

Each portfolio construction strategy offers distinct benefits and advantages. Consider your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon to determine the strategy that best suits your needs. Remember, diversification is key to managing risk effectively, and these methodologies provide you with powerful tools to achieve it.

**1Ô∏è‚É£ - Go to the first configuration tab of a strategy (Model configuration) :**&#x20;

**2Ô∏è‚É£  - Then select the strategy model that best suits you, based on your objectives, your risk tolerance and the time horizon of your investments :**&#x20;

### Rebalancing occurrence

Over time, asset allocations may change as market performance changes asset values. Rebalancing involves the periodic purchase or sale of assets in a portfolio to return to and maintain the desired initial level of asset allocation. These levels are intended to match your risk tolerance and desire for reward.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ - Determine the temporality in each rebalancing :**

### Capital Protection (CPPI)

The CPPI allows an investor to maintain exposure to the potential upside of risky assets while providing a capital guarantee against downside risk. To guarantee the invested capital, a position in stablecoins dollars is maintained, in addition to the basket of assets that make up the performance driver.

{% hint style="info" %}
The value assigned to each asset depends on the "cushion value", defined as the current value of the portfolio, minus the floor value.
{% endhint %}

#### **CPPI Configuration**

* **Fixed :** The floor value is defined by the value of the initial investment, less the cushion value. The value of the initial investment therefore remains 100% of the floor value, even in the event of an increase in the maximum value of the portfolio.
* **Drawdown :** The floor value is represented by the predefined percentage, compared to the maximum value of the portfolio which is 100%. In the event of an increase in the value of the portfolio's assets, the new maximum value of the portfolio therefore becomes 100% for the predefined floor value.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ - If you want to use CPPI, choose a type of floor :**

#### Multiplier

The multiplier allows you to add leverage to the cushion value in order to increase returns.

For example, assume that the maximum potential loss between two rebalancing dates is 20% of the cushion value. In this case, you could use a multiplier of factor 5 to expose yourself to 100% of the cushion value, or a multiplier of factor 3 to expose yourself to 60% of the cushion value.

**5Ô∏è‚É£ - Adapt your multiplier based on the maximum potential loss between two rebalancing dates :**

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you use a multiplier that is too high relative to the maximum potential loss between two rebalancing dates, there is a risk that capital protection will be breached if your risky assets experience a sudden steep decline.
{% endhint %}

#### Floor percentage&#x20;

The ‚ÄúFloor‚Äù is defined as a fraction of the current value of the portfolio that the investor cannot afford to lose.

### Asset Selection

When it comes to choosing digital assets for your strategy, a tool powered by statistical algorithms has the ability to examine over 800 digital assets based on their market capitalization, Sharpe ratio, minimum variance , their correlation, etc. This ensures that you only include reputable and reliable assets in your portfolio.

It is also possible to use filters to select assets based on specific activity sectors. For instance, you could select the nine assets with the best Sharpe ratio in the gaming sector, decentralized finance, and infrastructure. You can also exclude categories if you do not want to expose yourself to certain sectors.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Excluded categories take precedence over included categories :** For example, if you include the "infrastructure" category and exclude the "interoperability" category, all assets with both categories as tags will be excluded from the asset pool.
