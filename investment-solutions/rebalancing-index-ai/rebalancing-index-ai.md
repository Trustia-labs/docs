## Tailored your Systematic Portfolio Management

Our product presents an innovative solution for digital asset portfolio construction and management, utilizing the power of our dedicated statistical algorithms to deliver an optimized investment strategy bespoke to your unique goals. The statistical algorithm aids in adopting the most fitting strategy based on your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon, employing methodologies such as Equal Weighting, Market Capitalization Weighting, Maximum Sharpe Ratio Weighting, Minimum Variance Weighting. Further functionalities include Dynamic Asset Allocation and Customized Strategy.

#### Crypto Selection

When it comes to choosing digital assets for your index, an statistical algorithms powered tool has the capability to review the over 800+ digital assets based on their market capitalization, Sharpe ratio, or minimum variance. This ensures that you only include reputable and reliable assets in your index. Moreover, statistical algorithms and AI can help identify trends, patterns, and potential risks associated with each digital asset.

It is also possible to use filters to select assets based on specific activity sectors. For instance, you could select the nine assets with the best Sharpe ratio in the gaming sector, decentralized finance, and infrastructure.

#### Weighting Strategies

With your pool of assets selected, the next step is to determine the weighting of each asset within the index. AI can help you apply various strategies and find the most suitable approach for your investment goals :

1. **Equal Weighting :** The Equal Weighting strategy equally assigns weights to each digital asset in your portfolio, thereby treating all assets with equal significance. This approach democratizes your investment portfolio and promotes diversification, mitigating the influence of any single digital asset.
2. **Market Capitalization Weighting :** The Market Capitalization Weighting strategy is a method of portfolio construction that involves weighting assets based on their market capitalization. Assets with higher market capitalization will have a greater weighting in the portfolio compared to assets with lower market capitalization. This strategy suits investors seeking exposure to leading market players.
3. **Maximum Sharpe Ratio Weighting :** Maximizing the Sharpe ratio is an approach used in portfolio management to select assets or investments that offer the best risk-adjusted return. This strategy aims to construct a portfolio that provides the highest possible Sharpe ratio by combining assets with high returns and low volatility.
4. **Minimum Variance Weighting :** Minimum Variance Weighting (or minimum variance allocation) is an approach used in finance to construct a portfolio of assets that aims to minimize the overall variance of portfolio returns. The objective is to find an optimal combination of weights assigned to each asset in the portfolio in order to minimize overall volatility.

Each portfolio construction strategy offers distinct benefits and advantages. Equal Weighting ensures balanced importance, Market Capitalization Weighting captures market dynamics, Maximum Sharpe Ratio Weighting optimizes risk-adjusted returns, and Minimum Variance Weighting minimizes volatility. Consider your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon to determine the strategy that best suits your needs. Remember, diversification is key to managing risk effectively, and these methodologies provide you with powerful tools to achieve it.

#### **Dynamic Asset Allocation**&#x20;

Our product doesn't just set and forget; it continuously analyzes market conditions to adjust your portfolio's asset allocation. This helps maintain a predefined level of risk or target a specific performance benchmark, adapting to market shifts and trends. Consider a market downturn where certain sectors are hit hard. Our dynamic asset allocation tool would adjust the weights of these underperforming assets to protect your portfolio.

Over time, asset allocations can change as market performance alters the values of the assets. Rebalancing involves periodically buying or selling the assets in a portfolio to regain and maintain that original, desired level of asset allocation. Those levels are intended to match an investor's tolerance for risk and desire for reward.

#### **Customized Strategy**&#x20;

Our AI can create a personalized weighting strategy, uniquely tailored to your investment goals, risk tolerance, and market outlook. This means your portfolio isn't just efficientâ€”it's efficient for _you_. For example, if you have a long-term investment horizon and a high-risk tolerance, the AI could craft a strategy that leans heavily into high-growth, high-volatility assets.

#### Value propositions&#x20;

Our product offers a comprehensive suite of AI-powered tools for digital asset portfolio construction and management that cater to a wide range of investment strategies and goals. Whether you seek equal diversification, alignment with market capitalization, optimization for the best risk-adjusted return, or minimization of portfolio variance, our AI has you covered. Alongside Dynamic Asset Allocation and Customized Strategy features, our product assures a flexible, adaptive, and bespoke approach to meet your unique investment needs. Utilizing these methodologies, you can manage risk effectively and achieve your investment objectives in the evolving digital financial landscape.
