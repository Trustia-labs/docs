# Statistical Arbitrage

## Introduction

Statistical arbitrage is a trading strategy that seeks to profit from pricing inefficiencies in financial markets using statistical analysis. The strategy typically involves identifying pairs of stocks that have historically exhibited a strong correlation in their price movements, but which have temporarily diverged from each other. It involves selecting two stocks with similar characteristics, such as in the same industry or with similar market capitalizations, and taking offsetting positions in them. The idea is to simultaneously buy the underpriced stock and sell the overpriced stock in the pair, in the expectation that the prices will eventually converge and generate a profit.

If the spread between the two stocks widens, the trader can sell the stock that has risen and buy the stock that has fallen, and vice versa if the spread narrows. Pairs trading requires careful analysis of historical price relationships and statistical techniques to identify the optimal entry and exit points for each trade.

## How to Develop a Pairs Trading Strategy in Three Steps

1. During the pairs selection stage, we aim to identify securities that move in tandem. This is accomplished by utilizing techniques such as cointegration tests and distance metrics.
2. The following stage involves developing a spread model that optimizes mean-reversion and guarantees market neutrality for the strategy.
3. Finally, the trading rules are established according to the approach utilized and the behavior of the spread.

## Cryptocurrencies Advantages & Drawbacks

Although the cryptocurrency market is the youngest and has less research than other assets, it holds significant potential for statistical arbitrage in theory. Cryptocurrencies' inefficiency is greater than that of stocks or forex markets, suggesting that trading in this market may be even more profitable than in other areas. However, a major obstacle for crypto traders currently is that only a limited number of top-traded coins are available for short-selling, and not all exchanges offer this option.
