#### Categories

When it comes to choosing digital assets for your strategy, a tool powered by statistical algorithms has the ability to examine over 800 digital assets based on their market capitalization, Sharpe ratio, minimum variance , their correlation, etc. This ensures that you only include reputable and reliable assets in your portfolio.

It is also possible to use filters to select assets based on specific activity sectors. For instance, you could select the nine assets with the best Sharpe ratio in the gaming sector, decentralized finance, and infrastructure. You can also exclude categories if you do not want to expose yourself to certain sectors.

**9️⃣ - Choose the categories you want to include and exclude to target specific sectors, but also to diversify your portfolio :**

**Excluded categories take precedence over included categories :** For example, if you include the "infrastructure" category and exclude the "interoperability" category, all assets with both categories as tags will be excluded from the asset pool.
{% endhint %}
