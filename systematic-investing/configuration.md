# Configuration

### Weighting Strategies

Each portfolio construction strategy offers distinct benefits and advantages. Consider your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon to determine the strategy that best suits your needs. Remember, diversification is key to managing risk effectively, and these methodologies provide you with powerful tools to achieve it.

The statistical algorithm helps you apply various strategies and determines the weighting of each asset within the index to find the approach best suited to your investment objectives :



### Asset Selection

When it comes to choosing digital assets for your strategy, a tool powered by statistical algorithms has the ability to examine over 800 digital assets based on their market capitalization, Sharpe ratio, minimum variance , their correlation, etc. This ensures that you only include reputable and reliable assets in your portfolio.

It is also possible to use filters to select assets based on specific activity sectors. For instance, you could select the nine assets with the best Sharpe ratio in the gaming sector, decentralized finance, and infrastructure. You can also exclude categories if you do not want to expose yourself to certain sectors.

**Excluded categories take precedence over included categories :** For example, if you include the "infrastructure" category and exclude the "interoperability" category, all assets with both categories as tags will be excluded from the asset pool.

### Capital Protection

Each portfolio construction strategy offers distinct benefits and advantages. Consider your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon to determine the strategy that best suits your needs. Remember, diversification is key to managing risk effectively, and these methodologies provide you with powerful tools to achieve it.

The CPPI allows an investor to maintain exposure to the potential upside of risky assets while providing a capital guarantee against downside risk. To guarantee the invested capital, a position in dollars is maintained, in addition to the basket of assets that make up the performance driver.

1. **Risk Minimization** : By setting a floor for the portfolio value, investors can be assured that even in the case of unfavorable market movements, their portfolio's value will not fall below a certain level.&#x20;
2. **Growth Potential** : While capital protection can help minimize losses, it does not limit the potential for gain. If the risky assets in the portfolio increase in value, the portfolio will benefit from this growth. This offers a balance between security and potential for return.

The value assigned to each asset depends on the "cushion value", defined as the current value of the portfolio, minus the floor value.
