# Capital Protection

### Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI)

The CPPI allows an investor to maintain exposure to the potential upside of risky assets while providing a capital guarantee against downside risk. To guarantee the invested capital, a position in stablecoins dollars is maintained, in addition to the basket of assets that make up the performance driver.

**Risk Minimization** : By setting a floor for the portfolio value, investors can be assured that even in the case of unfavorable market movements, their portfolio's value will not fall below a certain level.&#x20;

**Growth Potential** : While capital protection can help minimize losses, it does not limit the potential for gain. If the risky assets in the portfolio increase in value, the portfolio will benefit from this growth. This offers a balance between security and potential for return.

### Definition&#x20;

**The “Floor” is defined as :** a fraction of the current value of the portfolio that the investor cannot afford to lose. The latter therefore represents the value at which the portfolio uses 100% of its capital in dollar stablecoins.

**The “Cushion” is defined as :** the difference between the current value of the portfolio and the floor value. The latter represents the current value of the guarantee. This is therefore the maximum theoretical amount that can be lost over a period without affecting the capital guarantee.
