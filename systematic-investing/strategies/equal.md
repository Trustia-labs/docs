# Equal

Equal weighting in portfolio construction is a method that democratizes investment by assigning equivalent importance to each asset, regardless of its size. This strategy emerged from the observation that small-cap stocks have often offered higher returns in the past, drawing attention due to the historical performance of small-size stocks and the emergence of various exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

With over 80 equal-weight indices developed by Standard & Poor's, combining various market capitalizations, markets, and sectors, this approach has been widely adopted and analyzed. Although small-cap stocks are generally considered higher-risk investments with higher return potential compared to large caps, in theory, giving greater weight to the smaller names in the S\&P 500 index in an equal-weight portfolio should increase the portfolio's return potential. Historically, this has been the case on several occasions, but in the short term.

From September 2020 to September 2021, the total one-year return for the S\&P 500 Equal Weight Index (EWI) was 41.93%, vs. 33.72% for the traditional S\&P 500 Index. However, in the long term, the gap narrows and, in fact, the returns reverse, with the 10-year annualized total return of the equal-weight S\&P 500 index being slightly lower than that of the traditional S\&P 500 index.

### **Summary**&#x20;

The Equal Weighting strategy equally assigns weights to each digital asset in your portfolio, thereby treating all assets with equal significance. This approach democratizes your investment portfolio and promotes diversification, mitigating the influence of any single digital asset.
