# Maximum Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe ratio, named after Nobel Laureate William F. Sharpe, is a measure of a portfolio's risk-adjusted performance. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return from the portfolio's expected return and dividing the result by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns, where a higher ratio indicates a more attractive risk-adjusted performance.

Consider a Formula 1 driver facing uncertain weather with intermittent showers. They must choose between dry weather tires, which maximize speed on a dry track but are risky in the rain, and wet weather tires, which offer more control but less speed. It's a gamble: if the rain stops, the dry weather tires could give them a decisive advantage. The Sharpe ratio is like the tool that assesses this gamble, measuring the portfolio's performance (the speed) relative to the risk of changing conditions (the weather).

In practice, a Sharpe ratio of 1 or more indicates that the investment is generating returns above those of a risk-free asset. Values above 1, approaching 2 or 3, categorize the investment as significantly superior. To construct a portfolio with a high Sharpe ratio, it is recommended to incorporate specific strategies that can help increase returns while minimizing risks, such as investing in diversified assets and risk management with capital protection to hedge against market volatility.

**The portfolio weighting is calculated using the following formula :**&#x20;

$$\begin{align}         max  & & \frac{\mu^T w - r_f}{(w^T \sum w) ^{\frac{1}{2}}} \\         s.t. & &  \sum _{j=1} ^N w_j = 1 \\              & & w_j \geq 0, \ j = 1, \dots, N     \end{align}$$

{% hint style="info" %}
In this formula,$$μTw$$ represents the expected return of the portfolio, $$rf​$$ is the risk-free rate of return, $$wTΣw​$$ is the standard deviation of the portfolio's returns, which measures volatility or risk, and $$w$$ is the combination of weights that offers the best risk-adjusted return.
{% endhint %}

### **Summary**&#x20;

Maximizing the Sharpe ratio is an approach used in portfolio management to select assets or investments that offer the best risk-adjusted return. This strategy aims to construct a portfolio that provides the highest possible Sharpe ratio by combining assets with high returns and low volatility.
