# Capital Protection

Capital Protection

The CPPI is a type of portfolio insurance in which the investor sets a floor on the percentage value of their portfolio, then structures the asset allocation around this condition. Our CPPI module offers the possibility of **protecting your capital, thus adding an additional layer of security to your systematic portfolio management strategies.**

The CPPI allows an investor to maintain exposure to the potential upside of risky assets while **providing a capital guarantee against downside risk.** To guarantee the invested capital, a position in dollars is maintained, in addition to the basket of assets that make up the performance driver.

1. **Risk Minimization** : By setting a floor for the portfolio value, investors can be assured that even in the case of unfavorable market movements, **their portfolio's value will not fall below a certain level**.&#x20;
2. **Growth Potential** : While capital protection can help minimize losses, it does not limit the potential for gain. If the risky assets in the portfolio increase in value, **the portfolio will benefit from this growth**. This offers a balance between security and potential for return.
