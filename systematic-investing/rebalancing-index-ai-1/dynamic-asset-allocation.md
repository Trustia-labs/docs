# Dynamic Asset Allocation

## **Dynamic Asset Allocation**&#x20;

Our product doesn't just set and forget; it **continuously analyzes market conditions to adjust your portfolio's asset allocation**. This helps maintain a predefined level of risk or target a specific performance benchmark, adapting to market shifts and trends. Consider a market downturn where certain sectors are hit hard. Our dynamic asset allocation tool would adjust the weights of these underperforming assets to protect your portfolio.

{% hint style="info" %}
Over time, asset allocations can change as market performance alters the values of the assets. Rebalancing involves periodically buying or selling the assets in a portfolio to regain and maintain that original, desired level of asset allocation. Those levels are intended to match an investor's tolerance for risk and desire for reward.
