## **Determining the Size of Your Asset Pool for Strategic Precision**

The asset pool size is a fundamental aspect of configuring your investment strategy, representing the total number of assets that can be included within your portfolio. This choice is crucial in determining the breadth and diversity of your investment approach, with an upper limit of 20 assets to ensure focused and manageable portfolio management.

### **Choosing Your Asset Pool Size**

When selecting the size of your asset pool, consider the following:

1. **Investment Goals:** Your investment objectives should guide the diversity of your asset pool. A broader range of assets might be suitable for those seeking diversified exposure across various sectors and asset classes.
2. **Risk Tolerance:** The size of your asset pool also reflects your risk management strategy. A larger pool can offer more diversification, potentially reducing risk, while a smaller pool allows for more concentrated investments in areas you're particularly bullish on.
3. **Management Capacity:** Consider your ability to effectively monitor and manage the chosen number of assets. A smaller asset pool might be easier to manage and optimize for those with limited time or resources.

### **Setting Your Asset Pool Size**

* To set the size of your asset pool, simply select the desired number of assets you wish to include in your strategy, up to the maximum limit of 20. This decision will shape the structure of your portfolio, influencing its performance and how well it aligns with your investment philosophy.

Selecting the size of your asset pool is a critical step in customizing your investment strategy. Whether you aim for wide diversification or a more concentrated portfolio, the chosen number of assets will play a key role in defining your investment journey's success.
