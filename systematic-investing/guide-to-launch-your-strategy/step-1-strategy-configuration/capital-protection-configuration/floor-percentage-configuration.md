## **Understanding and Setting Your Investment 'Floor'**

In the realm of investment strategies, the concept of the "Floor" plays a crucial role in capital protection. It represents a critical threshold: a specific fraction of your portfolio's current value below which you cannot afford to see your investment drop. This safeguard ensures that a portion of your capital is always preserved, regardless of market fluctuations, by converting it into dollar stablecoins if the portfolio's value approaches this predefined level.

### **How to Determine Your Floor Value**

The Floor value is typically determined as a percentage of the initial investment or the wealth peak, providing a clear benchmark for the minimum acceptable value of your portfolio. This strategic approach allows you to tailor your investment's safety net to your personal risk tolerance and financial goals.

### **Example of Setting the Floor:**

**Define the Percentage of Capital Protection:** Decide on the portion of your capital you wish to safeguard against market downturns. For instance, if you wish to protect 75% of your initial investment, this percentage becomes your Floor. Should the market value of your portfolio approach this threshold, a portion of your assets will automatically be converted into dollar stablecoins, effectively locking in this minimum value.

### **Implementing Your Floor Strategy**

By defining the percentage of your capital you want to protect, you take a proactive step towards managing investment risk. This decision should align with your overall investment strategy, balancing the potential for growth against the necessity of capital preservation.

Choosing your Floor is a personal decision that reflects your financial objectives and comfort level with risk. It is a fundamental component of a comprehensive investment strategy, especially for those utilizing CPPI to protect and grow their investments in volatile markets.

In summary, setting your Floor is about establishing a safety net for your investments. It's about deciding the minimum portfolio value you're comfortable with and using stablecoins as a buffer against market volatility. This ensures that, no matter how the markets move, a portion of your investments remains secure, providing peace of mind and a foundation for future growth.
