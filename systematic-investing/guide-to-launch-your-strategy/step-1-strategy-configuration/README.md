Welcome to the interface designed for simplicity yet powerful enough to offer comprehensive configuration options for your investment algorithms. This is your gateway to customizing strategies that align with your financial objectives and risk appetite.

**Strategy Configuration: Tailor Your Investment Approach**

* [**Weighting Strategy Selection:**](weighting-selection/strategy-selection.md) Choose the right weighting strategy that suits your investment style, whether it's maximizing returns, minimizing volatility, or achieving optimal diversification.
* [**Min/Max Allocation for Each Asset**](weighting-selection/minimum-and-maximum-allocation-selection.md)**:** Define the minimum and maximum allocation limits for each asset in your portfolio, ensuring a balanced and risk-adjusted distribution.
* [**Rebalancing Occurrence**](ocurence-rebalancement-selection.md)**:** Schedule how frequently your portfolio should rebalance to maintain your chosen asset allocation, adapting to market changes and investment goals.
* [**Assets Auto-Selection**](ai-asset-selector/)**:** Leverage our system to automatically select assets based on predefined criteria, simplifying the investment process.
* [**Assets Pools Size**](ai-asset-selector/asset-pool-size.md)**:** Determine the size of your asset pools to manage the diversity and exposure of your portfolio effectively.
* [**Include/Exclude Category for Auto-Selection**](ai-asset-selector/include-exclude-categories.md)**:** Customize your asset selection further by including or excluding specific categories, tailoring your investment to align with your preferences.

**Capital Protection Configuration: Safeguard Your Investment**

* **CPPI Type:** Choose the CPPI approach that best protects your portfolio against downside risk while maintaining exposure to potential upsides.
* [**Floor Percentage**](capital-protection-configuration/floor-percentage-configuration.md)**:** Set the minimum portfolio value you wish to protect, ensuring that your investments do not fall below this threshold.
* [**Multiplier**](capital-protection-configuration/multiplier-configuration.md)**:** Adjust the level of exposure to risky assets with a multiplier, balancing the trade-off between risk and return according to your risk tolerance.

**Platform and Exchange Configuration: Streamline Your Investment Process**

* [**Exchange to Use**](exchange-configuration/exchange-api-key.md)**:** Select the exchange platforms that you will use for trading, optimizing for liquidity, fees, and available assets.
* [**Amount to Invest:**](exchange-configuration/invested-amount.md) Specify the initial amount you wish to invest, setting the stage for your portfolio's capital allocation.

This guide is your first step towards turning investment complexity into a streamlined and efficient process. With these settings, you can personalize your strategy, ensuring that your portfolio reflects your investment vision and goals. Get ready to embark on a journey where efficiency and simplicity converge, empowering you to make informed and strategic investment decisions.
