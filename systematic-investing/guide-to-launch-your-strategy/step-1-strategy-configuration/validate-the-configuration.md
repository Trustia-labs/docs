With the foundation set and an initial asset pool at your disposal, you're now ready to personalize your portfolio further:

* **Asset Selection Phase:** Proceed to the "Asset Selection" stage, where you can fine-tune the composition of your asset pool. This step allows you to include specific assets you're interested in or exclude those you prefer not to invest in, providing a level of customization that ensures your portfolio truly reflects your investment vision.
* **Final Adjustments:** Utilize this opportunity to make any necessary adjustments to the asset pool, refining your strategy to perfection. This iterative process allows for a tailored approach, ensuring your final portfolio is precisely aligned with your goals and risk profile.
