#### Returns

**Adjusted returns** by the **risk-free rate** is a measure that takes into account the risk-free interest rate in the calculation of the returns of a portfolio or a financial asset. The risk-free rate represents the return that can be obtained without taking any risk, for example, by investing in government bonds.

The **average return** of a trading strategy or portfolio is a statistical measure that indicates the average return one can expect to achieve over a given period of time, typically measured in percentage. This measure is important for investors as it enables them to determine whether a trading strategy or portfolio has generated a positive or negative return over time.

#### Ratios

Ratios such as the Sharpe Ratio, Calmar Ratio, Treynor Ratio, and Sortino Ratio are crucial for evaluating the performance of an investment while taking into account the risk associated with that investment. These ratios enable investors to compare different investment options and strategies, taking into account various aspects of risk and return.

#### Volatility

Volatility is a measure of the variability of a financial asset's returns over time. It measures the magnitude of price fluctuations of a financial asset and thus indicates the amount of risk associated with that asset.

Investors who are willing to take risks may prefer more volatile financial assets because they generally offer higher returns, but they also carry a higher risk of significant losses. Investors who seek to minimize their risk may prefer less volatile financial assets, which offer lower but more stable returns.

Risk measurement in trading is a method used to assess the level of risk in a trading position or portfolio. There are several methods for measuring risk, which differ in terms of complexity and accuracy.

#### Value at Risk

**Value at Risk (VaR)** is defined as the potential financial loss amount within a specific enterprise, portfolio or position over a given **time period** with a certain **confidence interval**. Risk managers use VaR to understand and control the level of risk exposure of a specific position or entire portfolio and use it to measure the overall risk exposure of an asset.
