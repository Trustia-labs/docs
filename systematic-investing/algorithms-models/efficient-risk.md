# Efficient Risk

## **Balancing Risk and Return with the Efficient Risk Strategy**

The _**Efficient Risk**_ strategy serves as a crucial method for investors focused on mitigating the risk of their portfolio while aiming for a predetermined target return. This approach carefully selects asset weight allocations to temper risk, all the while pursuing the desired return outcome.

Consider the role of an architect tasked with designing a building. The objective extends beyond creating an aesthetically appealing structure; it must also endure severe weather and seismic events. In this analogy, the building's design symbolizes the target return—both visually appealing and functionally robust—while its resilience against extreme conditions represents the essence of risk management. The architect's challenge is to harmonize aesthetics with structural integrity, ensuring the edifice meets its design goals without compromising on safety.

For investors, the _**Efficient Risk strategy**_ embodies the pursuit of minimizing risk without forgoing the anticipated return. It is tailored for those with a clear target return in mind, aiming to reach this goal through the most risk-averse path possible.

In this strategy, the portfolio's weighting formula takes into account the covariance matrix of asset returns, expected returns, and the target return against the total number of assets. This calculation framework is designed to optimize the portfolio in a manner that judiciously balances risk against the investor's return objectives.

**The portfolio weighting is calculated using the following formula :**&#x20;

$$\begin{align}         min  & & w^T \sum{w} \\         s.t. & & \mu^Tw = \mu_t \\              & &  \sum _{j=1} ^N w_j = 1 \\              & & w_j \geq 0, \ j = 1, \dots, N     \end{align}$$

Where $$w$$ is the vector of portfolio weights, $$Σ$$ eis the covariance matrix of asset returns, $$μ$$ is the vector of expected returns, $$μt​$$ is the target return, and $$N$$ is the number of assets in the portfolio.

### **Summary**&#x20;

The _**Efficient Risk**_ approach is strategically geared towards reducing portfolio risk in alignment with a specific target return set by the investor. Unlike the minimum variance strategy, which aims for the lowest possible risk, Efficient Risk focuses on optimizing the allocation of risk to meet the target return efficiently. This method ensures that investors can achieve their desired financial outcomes with a calculated and minimal exposure to risk, embodying the principle of achieving maximum efficiency in risk management.
