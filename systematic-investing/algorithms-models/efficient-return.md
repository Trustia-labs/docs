# Efficient Return

## **Sailing Towards Maximum Returns with the Efficient Return Strategy**

The _**Efficient Return**_ strategy represents a sophisticated method in portfolio construction, designed to maximize returns for a pre-defined risk level. This approach leverages the concept of the efficient frontier to pinpoint the ideal mix of asset weights, ensuring optimal portfolio performance.

Picture a sailing race where the ultimate goal is to achieve maximum speed within a designated wind zone. Sailors adjust their sails to harness as much wind as possible, staying within the safety parameters. Here, "wind" embodies the potential returns, while the "defined wind area" stands for the targeted risk level. The sailors' challenge mirrors that of investors: to maximize returns (speed) without surpassing the acceptable risk (leaving the safe wind zone).

Rooted in _**Modern Portfolio Theory**_, the efficient frontier serves as the strategy's cornerstone. It identifies the array of portfolios that offer the highest return for a specified level of risk, with an "efficient" portfolio characterized by its inability to be outperformed by another portfolio with the same or lesser risk.

The efficient frontier is depicted as a curve, illustrating that any increase in risk is accompanied by progressively smaller returns, highlighting the principle of diminishing risk return. Portfolios situated on this curve are deemed optimal, striking the perfect balance between diversification and the risk/return trade-off.

In practical terms, investors strive to align their portfolio with the efficient frontier, thus maximizing expected returns for a chosen risk level. The allocation of assets within the portfolio is meticulously calibrated to meet this goal, optimizing the strategic positioning on the efficient frontier.

**The portfolio weighting is calculated using the following formula :**&#x20;

$$\begin{align}         max  & & \mu^Tw \\         s.t. & & w^T \sum{w} = \sigma_t^2\\              & &  \sum _{j=1} ^N w_j = 1 \\              & & w_j \geq 0, \ j = 1, \dots, N     \end{align}$$

where $$μ$$ is the vector of expected asset returns, $$w$$ is the portfolio weight vector, $$Σ$$ represents the covariance matrix of asset returns, $$σ2t​$$ is the target portfolio variance, and $$N$$ is the number of assets in the portfolio.
{% endhint %}

### **Summary**&#x20;

The _**Efficient Return**_ strategy aims to maximize the portfolio's return, anchored to a target risk value determined by the investor. Similar to the "efficient risk" approach but with a focus on return optimization, this method calculates the optimal asset weights to enhance returns in line with the predetermined risk, embodying the essence of "efficient return.
