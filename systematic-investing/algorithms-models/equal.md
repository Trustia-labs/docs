## **Democratizing Investment with Equal Weighting**

The _**Equal Weighting**_ strategy in portfolio construction champions a democratic approach by assigning equal importance to every asset, making no distinction based on size. This method shines a spotlight on the potential of small-cap stocks, historically recognized for their higher returns. The rise of various exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the notable performance of smaller stocks have further fueled interest in this strategy.

Standard & Poor's has developed over 80 equal-weight indices, encompassing a diverse range of market capitalizations, markets, and sectors. This widespread adoption allows for a broad analysis of the strategy's effectiveness. While small-cap stocks are typically viewed as riskier with a higher return potential than their large-cap counterparts, an equal-weight portfolio, by theory, boosts return potential by favoring smaller companies within the S\&P 500 index. This theory has been validated by historical performance, albeit with variations in the short term.

For instance, between September 2020 and September 2021, the S\&P 500 Equal Weight Index (EWI) boasted a one-year total return of 41.93%, outperforming the traditional S\&P 500 Index, which had a return of 33.72%. Yet, over the long haul, the performance gap between the equal-weight and traditional S\&P 500 indices narrows, occasionally even reversing, as seen in the 10-year annualized total returns.

### **Summary**&#x20;

Equal Weighting offers a straightforward yet powerful strategy: it equally values each digital asset in your portfolio, fostering a level of investment democracy and promoting diversification. This approach effectively dilutes the impact of any single asset, making it an attractive option for those looking to democratize their investment portfolio while embracing diversification's benefits.
